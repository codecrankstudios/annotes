- A s far as we know, all societies have possessed beliefs that can be grouped under the term religion.
- any set of attitudes, beliefs, and practices pertaining to whether that power be forces, gods, spirits, ghosts, or supernatural power, demons. 
  - **Note:** **Definition**:: Religion —
- In our society, we divide phenomena into the natural and the supernatural, but not all languages or cultures make such a neat distinction.
- supernatural—powers believed to be not human or not subject to the laws of nature— varies from society to society. 
  - **Note:** **Definition**::
- Beliefs about what is, or is not, a supernatural occurrence also vary within a society at a given time or over time.
- In Judeo-Christian traditions, for example, floods, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, comets, and epidemics were once considered evidence of supernatural powers intervening in human affairs. 
  - **Note:** Example::
- In many cultures, what we would consider religious is embedded in other aspects of everyday life. That is, it is often difficult to separate the religious, economic, or politi- cal from other aspects of the culture.
- the categorizing of beliefs as religious, political, or social is a relatively new custom.
- The ancient Greeks, for instance, did not have a word for religion, but they did have many concepts concerning the behavior of their gods and their own expected duties to the gods. 
  - **Note:** Example::
- When people’s duties to their gods are linked with duty to their princes, it is difficult to separate religious from political ideas.

- Animatism  A belief in supernatural forces. 
  - **Note:** Example::
- The details of religions practiced in the distant past cannot be ­recovered. Yet evidence of ritual treatment of the dead suggests that early people believed in the existence of super- natural spirits and tried to communicate with, and ­perhaps influence, them.
- Animism  A belief in a dual existence for all  things—a physical, visible body, and a psychic, invisible soul. 
  - **Note:** Example::
- As long ago as the 5th century b.c., Herodotus made fairly objective comparisons among the religions of the 50 or so societies he traveled to from his home in Greece. He noted many similari- ties among their gods and pointed out evidence of diffusion of religious worship.
- five such needs or conditions here: (1) a need for intellectual un- derstanding, (2) reversion to childhood feelings, (3) anxiety and uncertainty, (4) a need for community, and (5) a need for cooperation.

- One of the earliest social scientists to propose a major theory of the origin of religion was Edward Tylor.
- In Tylor’s view, religion originated in people’s speculation about dreams, trances, and death.
- In sleep, the soul can leave the body and appear to other people; at death, the soul permanently leaves the body. Be- cause the dead appear in dreams, people come to believe that the around.1 souls of the dead are still

- Tylor thought that the belief in souls was the earliest form of souls.2 animism religion; is the term he used to refer to belief in
- many scholars criticized Tylor’s theory for being too intellec- tual and not dealing with the emotional component of religion.
- One of Tylor’s students, R. R. Marett, felt that Tylor’s animism was too sophisticated an idea to be the origin of religion. Marett animatism—a suggested that belief in impersonal supernatural forces (e.g., the power of a rabbit’s foot)—preceded the creation spirits.3 of
- A similar idea is that when people believe in gods, they are anthropomorphizing—attributing human characteristics events.4 and motivations to nonhuman, particularly supernatural, Anthropomorphizing may be an attempt to understand what is otherwise incomprehensible and disturbing.

- Freud believed that these early practices gradually became transformed into the worship of deities or gods modeled after the father. 
  - **Note:** According to Sigmund Freud the father kept all the moment for himself and sons, when mature, join together and kill the father. But then son felt remorse and prohibited killing of a totem animal representing father.
- there is evidence that feelings about the supernatural world parallel feelings in everyday life.

- Freud thought that humans would turn to religion during times of uncertainty, but he did not view religion positively, believing that humans would eventually outgrow the need for religion.
- Bronislaw Malinowski noted that people in all societies are faced with anxiety and uncertainty. They may have skills and knowledge to take care of many of their needs, but knowledge is not sufficient to prevent illness, ac- cidents, and natural disasters. The most frightening prospect is death itself. Consequently, there is an intense desire for immortality.
- As Malinowski saw it, religion is born from the universal need to find comfort in inevitable times of stress.
- In religious ceremony, humans can commemorate and communicate with those who have died and achieve some measure of ways.6 comfort in these
- Theorists such as William James, Carl Jung, Erich Fromm, and Abraham Maslow have viewed religion even more positively: Religion is not just a way of relieving anxiety; it is thought to be therapeutic.

- If religion is good for health by reducing anxiety, why has the number of religious believers declined recently in so many countries?
- A comparison of countries suggests that the number of nonbelievers in a country is related to fewer stresses in the environment. So, greater economic development, less inequality, higher life expectancy, more peacefulness, and lower disease loads are all associated with a higher number of nonbelievers. These relationships support the lessened.13 idea that when uncertainty is lessened, the need for religion is

- Whatever the beliefs or rituals, religion may satisfy psychological needs common to all people.
- But some social scientists believe that religion springs from society and serves social, rather than psychological, needs.
- Émile Durkheim, a French sociologist, pointed out that living in society makes humans feel pushed and pulled by powerful forces. These forces direct their behavior, pushing them to resist what is considered wrong, pulling them to do what is considered right.
- These are the forces of public opinion, custom, and law.
- The more danger involved in fishing, the more taboos fisherman seem to have. 
  - **Note:** Example::
- Durkheim suggested that religion arises out of the experience of living in social groups; religious belief and practice affirm a person’s place in society, enhance feelings of community, and give people confidence.
- Durkheim noted that in societies organized into clans, each clan has its own totem animal; the totem distinguishes one clan from another. So the totem is the focus of the clan’s religious rituals and symbolizes both the clan and ritual.14 the clan’s spirits. It is the clan that is affirmed in
- Guy Swanson accepted Durkheim’s belief that certain aspects or conditions of society generate the responses we call religious, but he thought that Durkheim was too vague about exactly what in society would generate the belief in spirits or gods.
- Swanson suggested that the belief in spirits derives from the existence of sovereign groups in a society.
- According to Swanson, then, the spirits or gods that people invent personify or represent the powerful decision-making groups in their society.

- Evolutionary theorists have to deal with a paradox—human groups are quite cooperative, but how did cooperation arise when helping others has a cost to an individual?

- But what if an individual just pretends to participate in religious behavior to gain benefits from others?
- If religions require considerable participation and sacrifices (such as fasting, curtailment of activities, specialized dress), religious participation will be hard to fake for an individual who wants to deceive.

- Marett referred to such religious beliefs as animatism.
- For example, mana, a supernatural, impersonal force called after its Malayo-Polynesian name, is thought to inhabit some objects but not others, some people but not others.
- A farmer in Polynesia places stones around a field; the crops are bountiful; the stones have mana. During a subsequent year, the stones may lose their mana and the crops will be poor. 
  - **Note:** Example::
- Mana  A supernatural, impersonal force that inhabits certain objects or people and is believed to confer success and/or strength. 
  - **Note:** Definition::
- People may also possess mana, as, for example, the chiefs in Polynesia were said to do. However, such power is not necessarily possessed permanently; chiefs who were unsuccessful in war or other activities were said to have lost their mana. 
  - **Note:** Example::
- ![[assets/Ember - Anthropology (pg.689).pdf/SS_Ember-Anthropology(pg.689).pdf(pg541)_1.png]]

  - **Note:** *Difference between Mana and Taboo* —
- Taboo  A prohibition that, if violated, is be- lieved to bring supernatu- ral punishment.

- Supernatural beings fall within two broad categories: those of nonhuman origin, such as gods and spirits, and those of human origin, such as ghosts and ancestral spirits. 
  - **Note:** *Gods vs Spirits* —
- gods Chief among the beings of nonhuman origin, are named personalities.
- Gods  Supernatural beings of nonhuman origin who are named personalities; often anthropomorphic.
- They are often anthropomorphic—that is, conceived in the image of a person—although they are sometimes given the shapes of other animals or of celes- tial bodies, such as the sun or moon.
- The Maori of New Zealand, for example, recognize three important gods: a god of the sea, a god of the forest, and a god of agriculture. They call upon each in turn for help and try to get all three to share their knowledge of how the universe runs. 
  - **Note:** Example::
- The gods of the ancient Romans, on the other hand, specialized to a high degree. There were three gods of the plow, one god to help with the sowing, one for weeding, one for reaping, one for storing grain, one for manuring, and so 
  - **Note:** Example::
- Beneath the gods in prestige, and often closer to people, are multitudes of unnamed spirits.
- Some, who become known for particu- larly efficacious work, may be promoted to the rank of named gods.
- Some spirits who are known to the people but are never invoked by them are of the hobgoblin type. Hobgob- lins delight in mischief and can be blamed for any number of small mishaps; still other spirits take pleasure in deliberately working evil on behalf of people.
- Native American groups believed in guardian spirits
- Spirits  Unnamed ­supernatural beings of nonhuman origin who are beneath the gods in pres- tige and often closer to the people; may be help- ful, mischievous, or evil. 
  - **Note:** Definition::
- On the Day of the Dead, Mexican families adorn their loved ones’ tombs and provide offerings of some the deceased’s favorite things. It is believed that the spirits of the dead will  return for a visit. 
  - **Note:** As depicted in the movie Coco:
- Ghosts ancestor spirits are supernatural beings who were once human, and are ghosts of dead relatives.
- Ghosts  Supernatural beings who were once human; the souls of dead people. 
  - **Note:** Definition::
- Ancestor spirits  Supernatural beings who are the ghosts of dead relatives. 
  - **Note:** Definition::
- Although the belief in ghosts is nearly universal, the spirits of the dead do not play a very active role in the life of the living in all societies.
- In his cross-cultural study of 50 societies, Swanson found that people are likely to believe in active ancestral spirits where descent groups are important decision-making units.
- The descent group is an entity that exists over time, back into the past as well as forward into the future, despite the deaths members.23 of individual 
  - **Note:** Definition::
- As a Lugbara elder (in north- ern Uganda in Africa) put it, “Are our ancestors not people of our lineage? They are our fathers and we are their children whom they have begotten. Those that have died stay near us in our homes and we feed and respect them. Does not a man help his father old?”24 when he is

- Whatever type they may be, the gods or spirits venerated in a given culture tend to have certain personality or character traits.
- They may be unpredictable or predictable, aloof from or interested in human affairs, helpful or punishing.
- ![[assets/Ember - Anthropology (pg.689).pdf/SS_Ember-Anthropology(pg.689).pdf(pg543)_1.png]]
- Melford Spiro and Roy D’Andrade suggested that the god–human relationship is a projection of the parent–child relationship, in which case child-training practices might well be relived in dealings with the super- natural.25
- For example, if a child was nurtured immediately by her parents when she cried or waved her arms about or kicked, she might grow up expecting to be nurtured by the gods when she attracted their attention by performing a ritual. On the other hand, if her parents often punished her, she would grow up expecting the gods to punish her if she disobeyed them. 
  - **Note:** +
- William Lambert, Leigh Minturn Triandis, and Margery Wolf, in another cross-cultural study, found that societies with hurtful or punitive child-training practices are likely to believe that their gods are aggressive and malevolent; societies with less puni- benevolent.26 tive child training are more likely to believe that the gods are
- These results are consistent with the Freudian notion that the supernatural world should parallel the natural.

- The range of social structures in human societies from egalitarian to highly stratified has its counterpart in the supernatural world.
- Some societies have gods or spirits that are not ranked; one god has about as much power as another.
- Other societies have gods or spirits that are ranked in prestige and power.
- For example, on the Pacific islands of Palau, which was a rank society, gods were ranked as people were. 
  - **Note:** + Example::
- Although the Palauans did not believe in a high god or supreme being who outranked all the other gods, some societies do.
- monotheistic religions.
- Although means “one god,” most monotheistic monotheism religions actually include more than one supernatural being (e.g., demons, angels, the Devil). 
  - **Note:** +
- polytheistic A religion recognizes many important gods, no one of which is supreme. 
  - **Note:** Definition::

  - **Note:** +
- In his cross-cultural study of 50 societ­ ies (none of which practiced any of the major world religions), he found that belief in a high god is strongly associated with three or more levels of “sovereign” (decision- making) groups. 
  - **Note:** Case Study:: *Swanson* —
- Of the 20 sample societies that had a hierarchy of three or more sovereign groups—for instance, family, clan, and chiefdom—17 possessed the idea of a high god. Of the 19 societies that had fewer than three levels of decision-making groups, only two god.29 had a high

- many anthropologists take the view that religions are adaptive.
- Some theorists argue that religion helps individuals reduce anxiety and uncer- tainty.
- Others stress societal needs of solidarity and cooperation.
- But some particular customary aspects of religious belief, at least on the surface, do not appear to be adaptive.
- the Hindu belief in the sacred cow has seemed to many to be the very opposite of a useful or adaptive custom. Their religion does not per- mit Hindus to slaughter cows.

- The cows, and the males they produce, provide resources that could not easily be gotten otherwise.

  - **Note:** +
- The resources provided by the cows are varied.
- First, a team of oxen and a plow are essen- tial for the many small farms in India.
- In the present system, they do not feed the cows, and even though poor nutrition makes the cows relatively infertile, males, which are castrated to make oxen, are still produced at no cost to the economy. 
  - **Note:** +
- Second, cow dung is essential as a cooking fuel and fertilizer.
- The National Council of Applied Economic Research estimated that an amount of dung equiva- lent to 45 million tons of coal is burned annually. Moreover, it is delivered practically to the door each day at no cost. 
  - **Note:** + Fact::
- about 340 million tons of dung are used as

- Third, although Hindus do not eat beef, cattle that die naturally or are butchered by non-Hindus are eaten by the lower castes, who, without the upper-caste taboo against eating beef, might not get this needed protein.
- Fourth, the hides and horns of the cattle that die are used in India’s enormous leather industry.
- Therefore, because the cows do not themselves consume resources needed by people and it would be impossible to provide traction, fuel, and fertilizer as cheaply by adaptive.66 other means, the taboo against slaughtering cattle may be very
